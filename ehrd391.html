<h1>EHRD 391 Class Review!</h1>
<h2>Mel's Review:</h2>
<p>Professor Judy Sandlin, gives lecture in every class to prepare you for every upcoming exam. It
    is pretty easy to stay on track as long as you attend class and do the homework each time you 
    learn the material.</p>
</p>The best way to succeed in this class is to take notes for each lecture and follow along with
    the homework and practices. Going to office hours will help you greatly if you have lost track 
    and are struggling.</p>
</p>Overall, I would rate this class a 8/10.</p>
