<h1>EHRD 481 Class Review!</h1>
<h2>Maya's Review:</h2>
<p>Mrs.Fowler's class is great for students trying to prepare effectivly for the workforce and for post graduation!</p>
<p>What was most effective about the class is the opportunity to do mock-up interviews and resume buiding!</p>
<p>Overall, I would rate this class a 9.5/10!</p>

<h2> Mel's Review</h2>
<p> Professor Fowler is very kind and caring for her students. Her class was very helpful in seeing what the transition from college life to real real-life workspace will look like. She brought in various guest speakers from different companies which helped me get an idea of possible future careers. 
	If you have the opportunity to take this course, I highly recommend taking it with Professor Fowler!</p>
<p> Overall, I would rate this class a 10/10.</p>

<h2>Andres' Review:</h2>
<p>Dr. Fowler's class does exactly what it sets out to do, preparing students to enter the workforce and provides help with in-class assignments like resume reviews, mock interviews and more.There's even a textbook that is used that helps students discover more about what they want profesionally. 
  I would say that I was familiar with quite a bit of the content covered in class, however I still left with more knowledge than when I started. 
</p>
<p>I would rate this class a 9/10 only because it felt more HRD focused at times.</p>
