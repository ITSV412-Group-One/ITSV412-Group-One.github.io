<h1>EHRD 391 Class Review!</h1>
<h2>Mel's Review:</h2>
<p>Professor Judy Sandlin, gives lecture in every class to prepare you for every upcoming exam. It
    is pretty easy to stay on track as long as you attend class and do the homework each time you 
    learn the material.</p>
</p>The best way to succeed in this class is to take notes for each lecture and follow along with
    the homework and practices. Going to office hours will help you greatly if you have lost track 
    and are struggling.</p>
</p>Overall, I would rate this class a 8/10.</p>

<h2>Danny's Review:</h2>
<p>Professor Sandlin's course on Measurement and Evaluation in Human Resource Development and
Technology Mangement is a rigorous, yet rewarding course.</p>
<p>While participating in the course, my routine involved attending lectures
and revisiting my class notes before working on my homework assignments. Engaging in collaborative
efforts with my classmates was vital in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the subject
matter. Additionally, I agree with Mel's suggestion of utilizing Office Hours, especially
when encountering particularly challenging concepts</p>
<p>Overall I would rate Professor Sandlin's course a 8/10.</p>
