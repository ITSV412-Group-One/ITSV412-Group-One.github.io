<h1>MGMT 209 Class Review!</h1>
<h2>Danny's Review:</h2>
<p>I strongly recommend considering alternatives before enrolling 
    in Keith Swim's MGMT 209 course. This class heavily relies on exams, 
    with a cumulative final covering 15 textbook chapters constituting 
    30% of the final grade. While Mr. Swim possesses a deep 
    understanding of the subject matter, his exams are notably 
    challenging, and his former attorney background tends to require 
    an exhaustive knowledge of legal details.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Swim's teaching approach leaves much to be desired, 
    with reported rudeness during office hours that can make students feel 
    inadequate. The course also entails a substantial amount of reading, 
    and the class's test and quiz averages consistently fall in the range 
    of below a C.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Mr. Swim has since retired, so this review may 
    no longer be applicable. Given these difficulties, it would be 
    advisable to explore alternative options if possible.</p>
<p>Overall, I would rate this class a 4/10.</p>

<h2>Maya's Review</h2>
<p>Taking MGMT 209 was a neutral experience that wasn't as terrible to take in comparison to the other business classes at Texas A&M. 
   If you are able to read through the textbook and understand key vocabulary words, then you are safe to say that you'll be able to pass the class.
   Despite the class only giving you three Exams to determine your grade, the exams are set up the same in which you will understand what is required
   to pass the exams.</p>
   <p>Overall, I would give this class a 5/10.</p>
