<h1>TCMG 303 Class Review!</h1>
<h2>Andres' Review:</h2>
<p>Dr. Walker's class has been my favorite class so far in the TCMG/ITSV program. His enthusiasm for the subject shines through and makes it fun to listen to his lectures.</p>
<p>Taking his class motivated me learn more about Linux and even install it on my laptop. </p>
<p>There isn't anything I would change from the class - from the way the lectures and labs are handled to the grading policies. Overall, I would rate this class a 10/10!</p>
