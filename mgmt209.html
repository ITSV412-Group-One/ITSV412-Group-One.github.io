<h1>MGMT 209 Class Review!</h1>
<h2>Danny's Review:</h2>
<p>I strongly recommend considering alternatives before enrolling 
    in Keith Swim's MGMT 209 course. This class heavily relies on exams, 
    with a cumulative final covering 15 textbook chapters constituting 
    30% of the final grade. While Mr. Swim possesses a deep 
    understanding of the subject matter, his exams are notably 
    challenging, and his former attorney background tends to require 
    an exhaustive knowledge of legal details.</p> 
<p>The course also entails a substantial amount of reading, 
    and the class's test and quiz averages consistently fall in the range 
    of below a C.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Mr. Swim has since retired, so this review may 
    no longer be applicable. Given these difficulties, it would be 
    advisable to explore alternative options if possible.</p>
<p>Overall, I would rate this class a 4/10.</p>
