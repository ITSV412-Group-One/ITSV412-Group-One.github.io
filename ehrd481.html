<h2> Mel's Review</h2>
<p> Professor Fowler is very kind and caring for her students. Her class was very helpful in seeing what the transition from college life to real real-life workspace will look like. She brought in various guest speakers from different companies which helped me get an idea of possible future careers. 
	If you have the opportunity to take this course, I highly recommend taking it with Professor Fowler!</p>
<p> Overall, I would rate this class a 10/10.</p>
